# phototools

My own tools to:
- Automatically (re)compress pictures in a directory.
- Automatically rename pictures.
- Automatically align/delete pictures when I'm working with duplicates. E.g.: when I have .tif duplicates of raw files on which noise reduction was applied, I'm working with the denoised .tif files, but I want the raw files for which I deleted the associated .tif files to be deleted as well.
- Automatically dispatch pictures when I'm done working them:
  - Raw files and project files (e.g.: from Hugin) go into a backup directory.
  - Jpeg files go into the albums directory.
